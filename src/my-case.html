      <h3>Overview</h3>
      <p>Redesign of Norsk-tipping.no, the biggest webshop in Norway. How we modernized Norsk-tipping.no and built a holistic user experience and created a user driven culture around web developement.</p>
      <h3>Wait, what is Norsk Tipping?</h3>
      <p>Norsk Tipping is the national lottery in Norway. The company is assigned by the government to offer attractive games, give profit to good causes and provide a safe and protective environment for responsible gaming. For me it is about dreams, sports and excitement.</p>
      <img src="images/cases/case2/what-is-nt.jpg">
      <h3>The problem</h3>
      <p>Norsk tipping were failing basic expectations of the customers on the digital channels.</p>
      <ol>
        <li><b>Hard to use: </b>A user experience full of friction and pain points for users, making the website very hard to use, specially for new customer</li>
        <li><b>Inconsistent:</b> Inconsistent and fragmented user experience</li>
        <li><b>Complains:</b> Customer service had a lot of calls from dissatisfied and angry customers that struggle handing in the lottery ticket</li>
      </ol>
      <h3>Starting point</h3>
      <p>This was the front page on norsk-tipping.no back when we started.</p>
      <img src="images/cases/case2/old-nt.jpg" height="720" width="731">
      <h3>The team</h3>
      <p>The design team was small. I was the first designer to start inhouse. Max Scrøder from Uniform. Simon Bognø. </p>
      <p>Pål Bergersen (my manager), Marius Vetaas Thomassen, Kjetil Grøsland. 
        Around 150 stakeholders.</p>
      
      <span>Our approach</span>
      <h3>Step 1: Building a deep understanding</h3>
      <p>Who are our users, what are their dreams and goals, how do our current solution serve them, what are their pain points, highlights and oppertunities do we have.</p>
      <h4>Customer support</h4>
      <img src="images/cases/case2/ks.jpg" height="2000" width="2000">
      <p>We build a strong connection with customer support. They interact with the customers everyday and have a lot of knowledge.</p>
      <div class="fakeimg"></div>
      <p>We did extensive research and user testing to gather the information we needed to map out the customer journey. We mapped out pain points, highlights and opportunities for the main journeys.</p>
      <div class="fakeimg"></div>
      <p>We worked closed with our around 100 stakeholders</p>
      <div class="fakeimg"></div>
      <p>We started tracking user behaviour so we could take data driven decitions</p>
      <div class="fakeimg"></div>

      <span>Ideation</span>
      <h3>Step 2: Building a design system</h3>
      <img src="images/cases/case2/ideation.jpg" height="2000" width="2000">
      <p>We created a strict and flexible system. Yes, both at the same time. Strict in the way that elements.</p>
      <p>Design of a system with reusable patterns and components balancing a cohesive and unified experience across ALL games, still giving space for each games characteristics and brand. Made possible with a common code library/styleguide.</p>
      <p>Modular design is about breaking down a design into small parts (modules), creating them independently, and then later combining them into a larger system.</p>
      <p>A design system’s purpose is to provide consistent, tested and reusable solutions for a common UX problem.
It means that it takes less time to build new features and pages. Whilst the initial period of designing and developing a pattern library may take a while, the benefits that follow will save time and improve the code base.</p>
 <p>Norsk Tipping expanded from 10 to 74 games. How to make place for the launch over 70 new instant games like casino, bingo and scratch games. To prevent people being overwhelmed by the big selection we created five new sections — each with games and content relevant for your liking.</p>
        <h2>Introducing 5 New Sections</h2>
        <p>Lottery, Sport, KongKasino, Flax (scratch games), Bingoria were all now providing sections with more relevant content for player.</p>

        <h2>Norsk Tipping with norsk-tipping.no — Nr. 1 and gold</h2>
        <q>“Norsk Tipping is at the forefront of this year’s competition with a well crafted, easy-to-use, user-friendly and visually appealing website. Like the Vinmonopolet, the company performs a demanding balance between tempting and warning, and the jury thinks Norway-tipping.no helps solve this social mission in a very good way, although it is naturally “tempted” more than “warned”.
        The jury congratulates Norsk Tipping with a well deserved victory and GOLD in Open Class, Farmand Award Best Website 2014!”</q>
